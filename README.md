# A STUDY ON " THE IRIS FLOWER DATA SET "
***

Iris dataset will be load, analyzed and used to code this project.

As one of the most popular dataset for begginers in statistics and code, The iris datase, contains measurements of four chracteristics as:
- sepal
- length
- sepal width
- petal length
- petal width 

Three different species will be used on iris flowers:

- setosa
- versicolor
- virginica

The goal of this code is to load the dataset, perform some basic analysis, and visualize the data as final project for GMIT - Programming and Scripting for Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics.
